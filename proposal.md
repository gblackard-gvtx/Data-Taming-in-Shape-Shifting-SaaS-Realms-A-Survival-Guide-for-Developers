### Titles: 
- **Data Taming in Shape-Shifting SaaS Realms: A Survival Guide for Developers**

### Category: Community

### Duration: 30 minutes

## Audience:
This session targets Python developers taking on roles in SaaS product data engineering or building custom extractions from SaaS providers.

## Prerequisite knowledge for this session:
Familiarity with Python and third-party libraries like requests and pandas is recommended.

## Description:
You work on a small project or maybe the compony you work for as partnered with a SaaS provider. You are tasked with extracting usage and client data from this system to be used down stream for analytics.
Where do you start? What tools should you use? How do you get started?
During this presentation I will discuss starting small, moving fast and about lessons I have learned during my career.

## Objectives:
Attendees will gain a better understanding of common issues with SaaS APIs, quick implementation tools for data extraction, and best practices when interfacing with SaaS APIs for data extraction.

## Detailed Abstract
#### The Problems:
Data resides behind APIs. SaaS providers may offer extraction tools at an additional cost. APIs might be fragmented into Microservices, necessitating chained API calls for comprehensive data retrieval. Communication lapses from SaaS providers regarding seemingly minor updates can disrupt workflows. API version changes, due to bug fixes, may impact subsequent versions.

#### The Tools:
We will explore existing tools and explore a minimum viable product (MVP) approach. The discussion will progress as we incorporate these tools with the evolving process.

### Getting Started
This section comprises five key components:
- **Project Structure**
    - Overview of project layout, including config.json.
- **Most Used Third-Party Libraries and their Significance**
    - Delving into argparse, requests, and pandas, and highlighting how they can be used.
- **Data Extraction and Validation**
    - Advocating default values for the response object, employing dictionaries for defaults, key checking in JSON responses, and setting run arguments in the main function.
- **Scheduling and Executing Pipeline**
    - Guidance on scheduling Python extractions using Cron or Task Scheduler.

### Past Speaking Experience
 I spent 5 years as a Systems Trainer/Project Manager, teaching schools and non-technical users how to utilize SaaS products. I conducted training sessions at various private conferences focused on Education Technology.

For the past three years, I've worked full-time as a backend Developer at Nelnet, a FinTech company. My primary focus has been Java-based IVR development. Recently, my work revolves around creating integrations between SaaS products, reporting, and data extractions.

While I've only been using Python for about a year, I've found its tools to be incredibly useful for my tasks. Outside of work, I participated in and won a national hackathon, NFTHackvision, within the NFT Crypto space.

This has been an opportunity for me to get myself in the Python community, which I've grown to deeply appreciate.
